# IA_DANTE

### Goal
###### The project : make a generator of mazes, this generator can make imperfect as well as perfect mazes.
###### Most importantly, this project consist of making IAs to solve these mazes !

### Program compilation and launch:
##### Compilation
  ```sh
        make
```

##### Generator
  ```sh
        ./generator x y [perfect] ---> the perfect is an option
```
It will generate a maze.txt and display the maze on the standard output !

##### IAs
  ```sh
        ./[IA's folder]/solver [maze] ---> you have to make a maze before or use yours :)
```

### Performances
To see which is the fastest, and see a beautiful output.
  ```sh
        ./perf.sh [maze]
```
It will run all the IAs and tells you which is the best !
